Class Loader Subsystem
The Class Loader Subsystem is responsible for loading class files into the JVM. It performs the following tasks:

Loading: It loads .class files (compiled Java bytecode) into memory. The class loader reads the bytecode and prepares it for execution.

Linking: This process involves three steps:

Verification: Ensures that the bytecode adheres to the Java language specifications and does not violate any security constraints.
Preparation: Allocates memory for class variables and initializes them to default values.
Resolution: Replaces symbolic references in the bytecode with direct references.
Initialization: The class loader initializes the class by executing its static initializers and static blocks.

The class loader subsystem consists of three main types of class loaders:

Bootstrap Class Loader: Loads core Java classes from the Java Runtime Environment (JRE).
Extension Class Loader: Loads classes from the Java extension directories.
Application Class Loader: Loads classes from the application's classpath.
2. Runtime Data Areas
The JVM divides memory into several runtime data areas, each serving a specific purpose:

Method Area:

Stores class structures, including metadata, constant pool, static variables, and method data.
It is shared among all threads.
Heap:

The runtime data area from which memory for all class instances (objects) and arrays is allocated.
It is also shared among all threads and is managed by the garbage collector.
Java Stack:

Each thread has its own Java stack, which stores frames. Each frame contains local variables, partial results, and information about method invocation and return.
The stack follows a Last In, First Out (LIFO) structure.
PC Register (Program Counter Register):

Each thread has its own PC register that stores the address of the currently executing instruction.
It helps the JVM keep track of which instruction to execute next.
Native Method Stack:

Contains all the native methods used in the application (methods written in languages like C or C++).
Each thread has its own native method stack.
3. Execution Engine
The Execution Engine is responsible for executing the bytecode. It consists of several components:

Interpreter:

The interpreter reads and executes the bytecode line by line. It is simple but can be slower for performance-critical applications.
Just-In-Time (JIT) Compiler:

The JIT compiler improves performance by compiling bytecode into native machine code at runtime. This compiled code is cached for future use, reducing the overhead of interpretation.
The JIT compiler optimizes frequently executed code paths, leading to better performance.
Garbage Collector:

The garbage collector automatically manages memory in the heap by reclaiming memory occupied by objects that are no longer reachable (i.e., no references exist).
It helps prevent memory leaks and optimizes memory usage.
4. Native Interface
The Native Interface allows Java code to interact with native applications and libraries written in other languages (like C or C++). This is useful for accessing system-level resources or libraries that are not available in Java.

5. Java Native Interface (JNI)
JNI is a framework that allows Java code to call and be called by native applications and libraries. It provides a way to integrate Java with native code, enabling developers to use existing libraries or optimize performance-critical sections of code.

6. Java Native Method Stack
The Java Native Method Stack is similar to the Java stack but is specifically for native methods. It stores information about native method calls and local variables used in those methods.

Summary of JVM Architecture
The JVM architecture is designed to provide a robust, platform-independent environment for executing Java applications. Its key components work together to load classes, manage memory, execute bytecode, and provide interfaces for native code. Hereâ€™s a summary of the architecture:

Class Loader Subsystem: Loads and links classes.
Runtime Data Areas: Manages memory for classes, objects, and method calls.
